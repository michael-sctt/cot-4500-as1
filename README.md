## Purpose of the Program
The purpose of this program is code up and test methods of calculus. Included in this program are code to 1) convert machine numbers, 2) chop a value to a specified precision, 3) round a value to a specified precision, 4) calculate both absolute and relative error, 5) find the minimum number of terms needed to compute an infinite series given a specific precision tolerance, and 6) determine the number of iterations needed to solve a given polynomial with a given precision tolerance with both the a) bisection method and the b) Newton Raphson method.
